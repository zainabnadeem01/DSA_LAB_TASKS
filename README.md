# DSA Lab Exercises

This repository contains all the lab exercises for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) from Week 1 to Week 15.  
Each week covers a different topic with implemented Java classes and examples.

## Folder Structure

- `week1_arrays/` - Array exercises and basic sorting (Selection, Bubble, Insertion)
- `week2_recursion/` - Recursion exercises (Print 1 to N, Count digits, Sum of digits)
- `week3_linkedlist/` - Singly and Doubly Linked List exercises
- `week4_sorting/` - Advanced sorting algorithms (MergeSort, QuickSort)
- `week5_stack_queue/` - Stack (array & linked list) and Queue exercises
- `week6_bst/` - Binary Search Tree basic exercises
- `week7_graphs/` - Graph exercises and traversal
- `week8_recursion_advanced/` - Fibonacci and other recursion problems
- `week9_trees/` - Binary Tree exercises
- `week10_sorting_advanced/` - HeapSort and other sorting
- `week11_hashing/` - HashMap and hashing exercises
- `week12_searching_advanced/` - Binary search and searching problems
- `week13_bst_advanced/` - Advanced BST operations
- `week14_graph_algorithms/` - Dijkstra and graph algorithms
- `week15_final_project/` - Mini DSA project combining concepts

## Notes

- All programs are written in Java.
- Each class contains a `main()` method for testing.
- Package names correspond to the folder structure for easy import in IntelliJ.
